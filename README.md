# SOLID Principle  


SOLID are five basic principles which help to create good software architecture.   
SRP: A class should have only one responsibility and not multiple.  
OCP: A class is closed for modification but opened for extension.  
LSP: Parent object should easily replace the child object.  
ISP: show only those methods to the client which they need.  
DIP: high level modules should not depend on low level modules but should depend on abstuction.
